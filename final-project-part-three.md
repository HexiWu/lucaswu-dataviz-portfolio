# Changes made since Part II
Since completing Part II, I made several adjustments that helped strengthen the clarity of my final story. One major change was shifting the analytic focus of my project. My original topic examined how hikers select trails based on difficulty and environmental features. However, I was unable to find a complete, reliable dataset to support that narrative, and I realised my call to action lacked a clear purpose. After reassessing the data sources available from the Healthy Lifestyle Report Dataset (Lenstore, 2021), I pivoted toward analysing outdoor activity participation, well-being, and accessibility. 

I also addressed several weaknesses identified in Part II. For example, my earlier draft lacked a strong conclusion and a tangible next step for the audience. The redesign now includes a clear call to action that directs readers to the National Park Service trail page so they can immediately apply what they learned. I also added image credits, dataset citations, and data-source labels directly beneath all visualisations to ensure transparency and avoid any copyright issues. In addition, I revised the writing to make transitions more intuitive—especially the shift from participation counts to participation frequency, and from frequency to well-being outcomes.

Another major change involved restructuring the narrative based on feedback from user research. Interviewees noted that the story lacked personal connection and emotional grounding. In response, I added personal photographs and a brief reflection on my own outdoor experiences in China and Yosemite National Park. This helped set a more relatable tone and made the topic feel less abstract. Finally, I trimmed and rewrote sections of text to improve pacing and make the story more concise, particularly in the parts discussing the benefits of outdoor activity.


## The audience
My intended audience is people who already like the idea of being outdoors but struggle to make it a consistent habit in their daily lives. This decision came directly from my interviews and user testing. Interviewees told me that while they value outdoor activity, their biggest barrier is realistic ways to integrate outdoor time into daily routines. Because of this, I intentionally avoided targeting specialized groups such as experienced athletes or environmental policymakers. Instead, I focused on ordinary students and working adults who want to go outside more but often feel they don’t have enough time or motivation.

To support this audience, I simplified the storyline and emphasised clarity: how many people go outside, how often they do it, and why it matters for happiness and longevity. I removed unnecessary detail and used visualisations that can be interpreted at a glance. I also strengthened transitions to ensure the narrative moves from awareness to insight to action. For instance, I added a clear explanation for why participation numbers alone are misleading, which sets up the need to examine outings per person. Similarly, before presenting the scatter plots, I introduced the question “Why does outdoor activity matter?” to keep the audience oriented and engaged.

Finally, because this audience appreciates practical guidance, I added a brief “next steps” section and a direct link to the National Park Service’s database of nearby trails. This ensures that the story ends not only with information but also with a concrete, accessible action the audience can take immediately.


## Final design decisions
Throughout the creation of my final deliverable, I made several deliberate design decisions to improve interpretability and narrative flow. First, I chose a clean, minimalist visual style with light-colored backgrounds and consistent color palettes. Since my audience is not composed of data specialists, I avoided unnecessary visual complexity and made the most important elements immediately noticeable—for example, using orange for participation counts and blue for participation rates, keeping these colors consistent across charts.

For the two scatter plots, I emphasized the regression lines rather than the individual data points. Interviewees noted that the dots alone felt overwhelming, so the trend line helped clarify the overall takeaway about the relationship between outdoor access, happiness, and life expectancy. Data labels and axis descriptions were also kept simple to avoid visual noise. I added all data sources directly below the charts, following feedback that my draft lacked clear attribution.

I also gave careful attention to storytelling rhythm. The sequence of visualizations was chosen to build a logical progression: participation → frequency → well-being → life expectancy. Each visualization answers a question raised by the previous one. 

For the call to action, I used a link to make the next step straightforward. I intentionally kept the recommended action small and achievable, consistent with the needs of my target audience. The overall goal was to present a data-driven story that feels motivating rather than overwhelming.


## AI acknowledgements
I used AI to help refine the wording of my story outline, draft certain sentences for clarity, and reorganize text for smoother narrative flow.


# Final thoughts
Working on this project has been one of the most rewarding parts of the course. The process of redesigning the story after Part II taught me the importance of audience-centered thinking. Although I initially intended to examine a different topic, shifting toward outdoor activity participation allowed me to tell a clearer and more meaningful story rooted in available data. 

If I had more time, I would explore additional datasets to analyze differences across age groups, urban vs. rural regions, or socioeconomic backgrounds. But overall, I am very satisfied with how the final project turned out. This project strengthened my skills in data storytelling, user-oriented design, and visualization, all of which will be valuable in my future work.
