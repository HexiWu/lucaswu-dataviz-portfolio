# Final Project Part I

## Summary of project: 
I first fell in love with hiking during my undergraduate years in China, where I spent weekends exploring trails across mountain parks and nature reserves. After coming to the U.S. for graduate school, this habit naturally continued — from unforgettable hikes in Yosemite National Park to monthly trips to Pittsburgh’s Frick Park. No matter the scale of the landscape, hiking has remained one of the most consistent ways for me to slow down and feel grounded.

But over time, I noticed something interesting about my routines. The trails I thought I liked weren’t always the trails I actually chose. I often imagined myself preferring rugged and scenic paths. But my actual trail choices were usually the ones that were easy to reach.
That realization sparked a bigger question: How do hikers actually make decisions about which trails to visit?

To explore this question, I turn to publicly available U.S. datasets that capture real recreation behavior:
	•	The U.S. Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) dataset (https://www.fs.usda.gov/recreation/programs/nvum/), which tracks visitor preferences for trail amenities, signage, safety information, infrastructure, and trail types in national forests.

By exploring this question, I hope to understand the subtle trade-offs hikers make between convenience and ideal preferences. Understanding these dynamics can help us make smarter choices as hikers and advocate for more well-designed outdoor spaces.

## Outline
- Introduction of Topic
- Summary of project
- Visualization 1&2&3:Show the demographic composition of hikers.
- Visualization 4:Compare stated trail-type preferences with actual trail-type usage.

Visualization 5 evaluates the  frequency of use of Mountain accessibility infrastructures and means such as cableways, public transportation, parking lots, and car roads.

Visualization 6 illustrates respondents’ perceived importance of various hospitality infrastructures when choosing mountain trails.

# The data
The U.S. Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) dataset (https://www.fs.usda.gov/recreation/programs/nvum/) tracks visitor preferences for trail amenities, signage, safety information, infrastructure, and trail types in national forests. 

# Method and medium
To complete this final project, I plan to use Shorthand to build the presentation and integrate interactive visual storytelling. All visualizations will be created using Flourish and Tableau. I initially hoped to include a dataset linking hikers’ path choices with geographic trail locations, but I was unable to find a publicly accessible dataset that provides spatial information and preference attributes. If I locate a suitable dataset later in the process, I may incorporate it into the final story.
