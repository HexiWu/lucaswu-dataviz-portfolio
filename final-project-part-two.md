# Wireframes / storyboards
To further develop my story outline visually, I built my draft directly in Shorthand. It allows me to prototype narrative flow in the format the final story will use. 
My draft Shorthand story can be viewed below:

# User research 

## Target audience
My intended audience is casual and intermediate hikers in the United States, especially those who frequently visit national forests or parks. I also want to reach people who enjoy outdoor recreation but rarely question the role of infrastructure in shaping their options.

Because this project also critiques how access and facilities influence outdoor behavior, my secondary audience includes park planners, designers, and outdoor-recreation researchers. Insights from this project may help them understand how access patterns influence hiking distribution and trail congestion.


## Interview script
My interview goals were based on three areas from the Good Charts critique framework:
	1.	Design execution – clarity, layout, readability, and visualization quality
	2.	Contextual awareness – whether the story was understandable, intuitive, and simple
	3.	Engagement and motivation – whether the story held attention and encouraged learning

| Goal | Question(s) to Ask |
|------|---------------------|
| **Design Execution: Aesthetics** | Are there any elements that are distracting or confusing such as layout, color, text, or font? |
| **Design Execution: Layout of Shorthand** | Does the chosen layout in Shorthand help the story flow smoothly? Does the structure feel intuitive? |
| **Design Execution: Types of Visualizations** | Are the visualizations appropriate for the hiking and infrastructure data? Are they clear, readable, or potentially confusing or misleading? |
| **Contextual Awareness: Clarity** | Is the overall story and objective clear? Are there places that need further explanation to understand the tension between stated preferences and actual behavior? |
| **Contextual Awareness: Simplicity** | Is the story easy to follow, or were there sections that felt more difficult to understand? |
| **Contextual Awareness: Intuitiveness** | Does the narrative feel intuitive as you scroll? Are there parts of the storyline or transitions that need more context or supporting information? |
| **Engagement and Motivation: Motivation** | After reading the draft, do you feel curious or motivated to learn more about how infrastructure shapes hiking experiences? |
| **Engagement and Motivation: Engagement** | While going through the storyboard, did you stay engaged throughout? Were there moments where your interest dropped? |
| **Engagement and Motivation: Learning Experience** | Did you learn anything new about hiking behavior or access? Is there anything else you hoped to learn after reading? |
| **Overall: Final Recommendations/Thoughts** | Overall, is there anything you would change, add, or reorganize? Any final thoughts or recommendations? |



## Interview findings
I conducted three interviews: one virtual session with a frequent hiker, one virtual session with a casual outdoor recreation participant, and one in-person interview with a friend who has limited experience with national parks. Each interviewee was given several minutes to freely scroll through my Shorthand draft before I asked structured questions. 
Across all interviews, participants understood the core message and felt the problem was relatable.

Below is a consolidated table of their responses:

| Questions Asked | Interview 1 (frequent hiker, mid-20s) | Interview 2 (casual hiker, early-30s) | Interview 3 (non-hiker, early-20s) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Are there any elements that feel distracting or confusing (layout, color, text)?** | Liked the clean layout; some paragraphs felt long and could be more concise. | Some text sections felt dense; suggested adding more spacing. | Visuals were clear; contrast between photos and text could be softer. |
| **2. Does the Shorthand layout make the story flow well?** | Opening transitions were smooth; liked the pacing. | Wanted clearer breaks between “preference vs. behavior” sections; recommended question transitions. | Vertical scrolling felt intuitive and easy to follow. |
| **3. Are the visualizations clear and appropriate?** | Bar charts were easy to read; the preference-vs-use chart was strongest. | Suggested adding a legend to facility-availability visuals; clarify colors. | Charts were understandable but the hex-style elements looked busy; needed labels. |
| **4. Is the overall story and objective clear?** | Very clear; appreciated that the story avoids blaming hikers. | Clear but could state earlier why the issue matters personally or socially. | Clear even for a non-hiker; requested one concrete national park example. |
| **5. Was the story easy to follow? Any confusing parts?** | Easy to follow; Yosemite anecdote could be shorter. | Infrastructure section transition felt abrupt; suggested adding a question prompt. | Easy to follow; suggested a short summary before the first visualization. |
| **6. Is the storyboard intuitive? Anything missing?** | Wanted preview images for major sections. | Hospitality infrastructure section needs clearer importance explanation. | Suggested simple definitions for terms like “trailhead infrastructure.” |
| **7. Did the story keep you engaged?** | Yes; preference vs. behavior comparison was relatable. | Mostly; facility-density chart felt long. | Yes; personal Yosemite story helped engagement. |
| **8. Did you learn anything? What else would you like to know?** | Learned how strongly facilities shape behavior; curious about regional differences. | Learned proximity influences behavior; asked if trends differ by demographics. | Learned new terminology; wanted examples of underserved trails. |
| **9. Final thoughts or recommendations?** | Shorten text and let visuals carry more weight. | Add small calls to action within the story, not only at the end. | Add one more concrete example showing infrastructure shaping trail choice. |


# Identified changes for Part III
Based on the interview findings, I identified several improvements. These changes will be incorporated into the next iteration of my Shorthand story.

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Text felt dense in several sections; some paragraphs were long. | Shorten key paragraphs, add more spacing, and break up text with sub-headers. |
| Some transitions felt abrupt, especially before the infrastructure section. | Add question-based transition slides to guide readers (“What shapes the trails we end up choosing?”). |
| Certain visualizations (facility maps, hex visuals) were unclear without labels or legends. | Add explicit legends, clearer labels, and short captions describing how to read each chart. |
| Need clearer explanation of why the issue matters personally or socially. | Strengthen the introduction with a sentence connecting my personal Yosemite experience to the broader issue. |
| Hospitality infrastructure section felt under-explained. | Add one clarifying sentence defining hospitality infrastructure and why hikers depend on it. |
| Non-hikers needed simple definitions for technical terms. | Add brief tooltip-style definitions (e.g., trailhead infrastructure, access facilities). |
| Some visualizations looked busy for users unfamiliar with data. | Simplify styling, reduce unnecessary colors, and use consistent visual encoding across charts. |
| Readers wanted concrete examples (parks, underserved trails). | Add one short example comparing two real trails with contrasting infrastructure access. |
| Engagement increased during personal story, but could be integrated more. | Add small personal touchpoints earlier and before the first visualization. |
| Readers wanted clearer hierarchy in the narrative structure. | Introduce section preview images and micro-summaries at major transitions. |

A consistent theme from the interviews was the value of personal connection. I will highlight my own hiking experiences earlier in the story and use them to anchor the larger question about how infrastructure influences trail choices. This will help guide readers into the topic and make the issue feel more relatable.
I will also review all visuals for consistency in style, color, and text formatting. Some charts will be simplified to reduce visual noise, and transitions will be framed as questions to better guide the audience through the narrative. Additionally, I will add citations for all datasets, screenshots, and images used, and ensure that any photos are from sources permitted for Shorthand to avoid copyright concerns.
