# About me
![Weixin Image_2025-12-04_174353_195](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81f1591d-cffe-4e48-a18f-40a183116023)

Hi! My name is Lucas Wu, and I’m a student in the Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University.  
I’m passionate about data — from how it’s collected and structured to how it can be analyzed to drive decisions and solve real-world problems.  

Outside of academics, I love traveling, hiking, and exploring new places. I find that seeing the world from different perspectives inspires my curiosity and creativity.

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I want to strengthen my ability to:

1. Communicate insights through visual storytelling
2. Choose effective color, design, and chart types to clarify complex ideas
3. Create visuals that not only inform but also influence decisions

After graduating from the MISM program, I plan to work as a data scientist. My long-term goal is to use data visualization and analytical methods to help organizations make smarter decisions. I believe combining data and storytelling can bridge the gap between technical findings and human understanding. Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and capturing landscapes through photography. These activities help me appreciate visual balance and design, which I think connects surprisingly well with data visualization. If you’re also passionate about storytelling with data or have creative visualization tools to recommend, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
